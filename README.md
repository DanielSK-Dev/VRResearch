Most of the boilerplate code & Models are from DaFluffyPotato
I tried to abstract the code so that it could be used as a game engine for Python VR, and the average developer would not have to deal with tilesets and other things like that. 
There is also just a basic test file called basicEnvironment.py that is the original test file.

**Controls:**
- Left Stick: Movement (hand oriented, not head)
- Right Stick: Snap Turn
- X: Jump
- B/Y: Mag Release
- Grip: Grab (weapons)
- Trigger: Grab (mags/bolts) & Shoot
